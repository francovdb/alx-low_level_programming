README for Directory 0x03-debugging

- In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project. Based on the main.c file above, create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.
- Copy this main file. Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
- This program prints the largest of three integers. Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
- This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration. Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
